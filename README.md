# RenewableEnergy_DatasetAnalysis
The "Hourly energy demand generation and weather" dataset contains 4 years of hourly data for electrical consumption, generation, pricing, and weather in Spain's 5 largest cities. It includes forecasts from the Transmission Service Operator (TSO) for consumption and pricing. The dataset allows for benchmarking against industry forecasts, visualizing load and supply curves, and analyzing the influence of weather and city factors on demand and prices. Key goals include improving 24-hour and intraday forecasts, predicting prices by time of day, and identifying the next generation source on the load curve.
